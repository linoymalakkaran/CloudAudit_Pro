# 🧪 Scenario: Year-End Audit

This scenario walks through a typical year-end audit, showing what gets created in the system and how work moves from preparer → reviewer → final reporting.

It’s written so you can map it onto:

- A first-year engagement (more setup)
- A recurring engagement (more roll-forward)

## Scenario setup (lightweight)

Assume:

- Period end: 31 Dec
- Engagement type: Financial statement audit
- Team: Manager + Senior + Staff

You can run this scenario without sample data by focusing on the *artifacts* and *decision points*.

## 1) Company + engagement setup

Primary goal: ensure the engagement is ready to accept planning, procedures, and evidence.

1) Confirm company profile and fundamentals.
2) Confirm audit period configuration.
3) Confirm team membership and permissions.
4) Confirm document organization approach (foldering/tags/metadata).

## 2) Engagement planning

Primary goal: set the plan so work is scoped, scheduled, and reviewable.

Typical decisions:

- Materiality approach (and what drives performance materiality)
- Key milestones and internal deadlines
- Staffing plan

Key artifacts:

- Planning memo / planning notes
- Initial work program structure (procedures created or templated)

- [Procedures overview](/docs/modules/procedures/overview)

## 3) Risk assessment

Primary goal: identify what matters and drive audit response.

Typical decisions:

- Significant risks and key assertions
- Where to rely on controls vs substantive procedures
- Areas requiring specialists or enhanced review

Key artifacts:

- Risk register / risk notes
- Linked procedures that respond to identified risks

- [Procedures workflow](/docs/modules/procedures/workflow)

## 4) Interim testing (if applicable)

Primary goal: do earlier work where it reduces year-end pressure.

Common interim candidates:

- Controls testing
- Walkthroughs
- System understanding and key process documentation

Key artifacts:

- Interim procedures and conclusions
- Evidence linked to each procedure

- [Status Guide](/docs/reference/quick-guides/status-guide)

## 5) Year-end fieldwork

Primary goal: complete substantive work and produce review-ready workpapers.

Expected “done” definition for a typical area:

1) Procedure steps complete
2) Evidence attached and clearly labeled
3) Exceptions evaluated and concluded
4) Cross-references added (where applicable)
5) Status moved to review

Key artifacts:

- Procedures with conclusions
- Workpapers / lead schedules
- Supporting documents

- [Workpapers module](/docs/modules/workpapers/overview)
- [Chart of Accounts](/docs/modules/chart-of-accounts)

## 6) Review & quality control

Primary goal: ensure work is consistent, defensible, and complete.

Recommended review approach:

- Review by risk/importance first (not by whoever submitted first)
- Return work with a single consolidated note when possible
- Require a short “what changed” summary on resubmission

Key artifacts:

- Review notes and resolutions
- Final sign-offs (where applicable)

- [Common Tasks: Route work for review](/docs/reference/quick-guides/common-tasks)

## 7) Finalization & reporting

Primary goal: generate outputs and finalize the engagement.

Typical steps:

1) Confirm all critical areas are complete and reviewed.
2) Confirm open items are owned, tracked, and resolved (or explicitly scoped out).
3) Generate draft outputs.
4) Perform final tie-outs (financial statements ↔ lead schedules ↔ trial balance sources).
5) Capture final approvals.

Key artifacts:

- Final reports
- Final engagement package

## Quick checklist (printable)

- Company, period, team configured
- Risks identified and mapped to procedures
- Interim work completed (if used)
- Year-end procedures/workpapers review-ready
- Review notes resolved and signed off
- Reports generated and tie-outs completed
