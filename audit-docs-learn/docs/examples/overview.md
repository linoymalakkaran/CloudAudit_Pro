# 💼 Examples (Overview)

Examples are end-to-end walkthroughs that show how the documentation fits together in realistic situations.

They’re intentionally “product-agnostic” where the UI details may change, but they are specific about:

- What decisions are made at each stage
- What artifacts get created (procedures, workpapers, evidence, reports)
- What “good” looks like for review readiness

## How to use these scenarios

1) Read the scenario top-to-bottom once.
2) Then follow the links out to the detailed docs only when you need depth.
3) Use the checklists to validate your own engagement setup.

## Scenarios
