# ✅ Audit Procedures (Overview)

Audit Procedures are the engine of the engagement: they translate planning and risk assessment into a structured set of steps to perform, evidence to obtain, and conclusions to document.

This module explains how CloudAudit Pro supports the full lifecycle of a procedure—from planning, to execution, to review and final sign-off.

## 🎯 What this module helps you achieve

By using procedures consistently, teams can:

✅ Ensure **all required steps** are performed for material areas  \
✅ Maintain a clear **audit trail**: who did what, when, and why  \
✅ Link work to **risks/assertions** and explain audit responses  \
✅ Keep evidence **organized and reviewable**  \
✅ Standardize quality through **templates, sign-offs, and review workflow**

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Procedure vs. Workpaper

- **Procedure**: The plan + execution container for a testing area (e.g., Cash, Revenue, AR Confirmations).
- **Workpaper**: The supporting documentation/evidence and analysis that substantiates the procedure’s conclusion.

In practice, procedures often contain multiple attached or linked workpapers (spreadsheets, PDFs, memos, extracts).

### Assertions and Risk Linkage

Even when the UI simplifies it, your documentation needs to explain:
- What assertion(s) the procedure addresses (existence, completeness, valuation, etc.)
- Which risks the procedure responds to (including significant risks)
- Why the nature/timing/extent is appropriate

## 🧱 Common Procedure Building Blocks

Most procedures include some combination of:

- **Purpose / Objective** (what you’re trying to conclude)
- **Population definition** (what’s in-scope)
- **Methodology** (sampling approach, thresholds, period)
- **Steps** (actions to perform)
- **Evidence** (reports, contracts, confirmations, reconciliations)
- **Exceptions & evaluation** (what failed, impact, follow-up)
- **Conclusion** (supported final statement)
- **Cross-references** (TB lines, workpapers, findings)

## 🟢 Statuses (Recommended)

If you keep statuses consistent, communication and review become much easier. A common set is:

- **Not started**
- **In progress**
- **Ready for review**
- **Returned with notes**
- **Complete**

See: [Status Guide](/docs/reference/quick-guides/status-guide)

## 🔒 Controls and Quality

Good procedure documentation supports quality control by:

- Requiring **sign-offs** (preparer + reviewer)
- Capturing **review notes** and responses
- Maintaining **immutability** after finalization (lock/closeout)

For the end-to-end review process, see:
- [Review & Quality Control Process](/docs/processes/review-quality-control)
- [Finalization & Reporting Process](/docs/processes/finalization-reporting)
