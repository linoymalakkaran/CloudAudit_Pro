## 🎯 What this module helps you achieve

✅ Store evidence in a consistent structure  \
✅ Track versions and prevent “which file is final?” confusion  \
✅ Link evidence to the exact procedure/workpaper step it supports  \
✅ Control access for client vs internal users

## 📌 Recommended evidence standards

- Use descriptive filenames: `Client - Report - Period - Date`
- Prefer portal uploads over email attachments (better audit trail)
- Keep one canonical location per document (link elsewhere rather than re-upload)

---

## 🔗 Link evidence to work

When you upload evidence, link it to:
- The specific procedure step
- The related workpaper
- Any findings or exceptions

This reduces review notes and speeds up completion.

- Uploading and organizing evidence
- Folder standards and naming
- Linking documents to procedures/workpapers
- Permissions and client portal considerations
