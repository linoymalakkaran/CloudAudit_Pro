# ✅ Audit Procedures

Audit Procedures define and track the testing you perform to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. They connect planning and risk assessment to execution, evidence, conclusions, and review.

## Common questions

### When do we create procedures?

Typically during planning, once risks are identified and the audit strategy is set. Procedures are then refined during interim and finalized during year-end fieldwork.

### Where does evidence live?

Evidence is uploaded/linked in Document Management and connected to procedure steps/workpapers.
