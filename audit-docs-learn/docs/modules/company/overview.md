# 🏢 Company Management (Overview)

Company Management is the foundation of CloudAudit Pro. It’s where firms configure the company environment that every engagement relies on: entity profile, fiscal periods, team access, and baseline settings.

In practice, most teams touch Company Management heavily during onboarding and at the start of every new engagement.
