# 📅 Periods

Periods define the audit window (e.g., FY2025) and help ensure the engagement remains consistent as data and evidence are collected.

## Typical actions

- Create the fiscal period (year/months) and set key dates
- Control when the period is open vs locked
- Keep audit work aligned to the correct reporting period

## Best practices

- Lock the period after issuance (prevents drift)
- If late client postings occur, document the TB version change and re-tie impacted workpapers
