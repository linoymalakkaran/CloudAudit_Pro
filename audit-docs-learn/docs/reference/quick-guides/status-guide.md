# 🟢 Status Guide

Statuses help the team coordinate work without constant meetings. The exact labels in CloudAudit Pro may differ, but the intent should stay consistent.

Use this guide to keep statuses predictable across:

- [Procedures](/docs/modules/procedures/overview)
- [Workpapers](/docs/modules/workpapers/overview)
- [Reporting](/docs/modules/reporting/overview)

## Recommended core statuses

### Not started

Meaning:

- No work has begun, or work was intentionally deferred.

Good practice:

- Add an owner and target date early so it doesn’t get forgotten.

### In progress

Meaning:

- Work is actively being performed.

Good practice:

- Keep partial notes as you go (what you tested, what’s left).
- Attach evidence incrementally instead of at the end.

### Needs review (or Ready for review)

Meaning:

- The preparer believes the work is complete enough for reviewer sign-off.

Before moving to review, ensure:

- Steps have conclusions (not just evidence)
- Exceptions are explained and cross-referenced
- Evidence is attached and readable

Process context: [Review & Quality Control](/docs/processes/review-quality-control)

### Returned with notes (or Rework required)

Meaning:

- Reviewer found issues that require updates before approval.

Good practice:

- Capture reviewer notes in one place (avoid scattered comments)
- When resubmitting, summarize what changed

### Complete (or Approved)

Meaning:

- Work is finished and accepted at the current review level.

Good practice:

- Avoid reopening completed items unless there is a real scope change.
- If reopened, record why (audit trail).

## Typical transition flow

Most items should follow this pattern:

Not started → In progress → Needs review → (Returned with notes → In progress → Needs review)* → Complete

## Tips for consistent usage

- Use “Needs review” only when you would be comfortable defending the work in a walkthrough.
- If evidence is uploaded but conclusions are missing, stay in “In progress”.
- For reporting outputs, don’t mark “Complete” until dependent workpapers/procedures are complete.
