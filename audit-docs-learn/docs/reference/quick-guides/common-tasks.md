# ✅ Common Tasks

These are the most frequent “day to day” actions across an engagement. Steps are written to be UI-agnostic, but map directly to the core modules.

If you want the full end-to-end context first, start with [The Audit Journey](/docs/processes/audit-lifecycle).

## Upload evidence (client-provided documents)

Goal: attach evidence to the right procedure/workpaper so it’s reviewable and traceable.

1) Confirm where the evidence belongs:
	- If it supports a test: attach to the related [Procedures](/docs/modules/procedures/overview)
	- If it supports an output schedule: attach to the related [Workpapers](/docs/modules/workpapers/overview)
2) Upload the file(s) into [Documents](/docs/modules/documents/overview).
3) Link the document to the relevant procedure/workpaper.
4) Add a short description: what it is, period covered, and what assertion it supports.
5) Ensure it’s ready for review:
	- Complete required metadata
	- Verify readability and completeness (all pages present)

Common review expectation: a reviewer should be able to understand “what this evidence proves” in under 60 seconds.

## Respond to a PBC request

Goal: deliver the right evidence with clear context and reduce back-and-forth.

1) Read the request carefully (scope + period + format).
2) If unclear, ask a clarifying question early (before uploading anything).
3) Upload the evidence to [Documents](/docs/modules/documents/overview).
4) Provide a brief response note:
	- What you provided
	- Period covered
	- Any limitations or assumptions
5) Link the evidence to any relevant procedure/workpaper so it’s auditable.

If you’re working client-facing, align with the approach in [Client Communication](/docs/processes/client-communication).

## Create a procedure (test step)

Goal: define a clear test with a reviewable result.

1) Determine the objective (what risk/assertion are you addressing?).
2) Define the population and selection approach (if applicable).
3) Write steps that are:
	- Specific (a new staff member could execute them)
	- Evidence-oriented (each step has expected evidence)
4) Define what “pass/fail” looks like (criteria).
5) Execute and record results:
	- Attach evidence
	- Record exceptions, if any
6) Set the status appropriately (see [Status Guide](/docs/reference/quick-guides/status-guide)).

## Route work for review

Goal: send complete work that is easy to review and unlikely to be returned.

Before sending for review, do a quick self-check:

- Are all steps completed with conclusions?
- Is evidence attached and clearly labeled?
- Are exceptions explained and cross-referenced?
- Is the workpaper/procedure signed off (as applicable)?

Then:

1) Move the item to a review status (see [Status Guide](/docs/reference/quick-guides/status-guide)).
2) Add a short reviewer note: what changed and what you want confirmed.
3) If review is time-sensitive, communicate the timeline explicitly.

Reviewer workflow context: [Review & Quality Control](/docs/processes/review-quality-control)

## Prepare a report-ready package

Goal: ensure reporting can be finalized without last-minute rework.

1) Confirm all critical procedures are complete and reviewed.
2) Confirm open points are tracked and owned.
3) Validate that lead schedules and key workpapers are finalized.
4) Generate outputs in [Reporting](/docs/modules/reporting/overview).
5) Ensure the engagement is aligned with [Finalization & Reporting](/docs/processes/finalization-reporting).
