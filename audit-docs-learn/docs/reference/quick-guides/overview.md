# ⚡ Quick Guides (Overview)

Quick Guides are short, task-focused pages meant for “I just need to do X” moments.

They complement (not replace) the deeper documentation in:

- [Business Processes](/docs/processes/audit-lifecycle) (the end-to-end audit journey)
- [Modules](/docs/modules) (where work happens in the product)
- [Glossary](/docs/reference/glossary) (terms and abbreviations)

## Who these guides are for

- New team members who want the fastest path to “productive”
- Experienced auditors who want a quick refresher on common workflows
- Admins and reviewers who need consistent status and review expectations
