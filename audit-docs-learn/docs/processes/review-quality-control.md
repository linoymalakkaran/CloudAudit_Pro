📧 CLOUDAUDIT PRO REVIEW NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WORKPAPER: Accounts Receivable Confirmations
PREPARER: Emma Thompson
REVIEWER: Sarah Williams
DATE: January 19, 2026

SARAH'S REVIEW NOTES:

🟢 COMMENT 1 (Suggestion):
"Nice work on the confirmation follow-up. Your 
documentation is very clear."

🟡 COMMENT 2 (Question):
"For the ABC Industries exception ($32K), you noted 
payment in Undeposited Funds. Did you verify this 
was the correct payment amount and customer?"

Emma's Response: "Yes - reviewed remittance advice 
from ABC, confirms $32K for Invoice #1234. Tie-out 
verified."

Sarah: "Perfect, thanks for clarifying."

🔴 COMMENT 3 (Issue):
"For alternative procedures on non-responses, you 
noted 'subsequent payment' for Customer A but didn't 
document the date or amount of payment. Please add."

Emma's Response: "Added - Payment of $42,000 received 
1/15/26, reviewed bank deposit #45678."

Sarah: "Good, issue resolved."

🟡 COMMENT 4 (Question):
"Sample size is 25 customers covering 82%. Given AR 
balance is $1.2M and PM is $45K, this seems adequate. 
Can you document why this coverage is sufficient?"

Emma's Response: "Added note: Sample covers 82% of 
total AR balance. Coverage exceeds 75% threshold 
per firm policy. Remaining 18% ($212K) is well below 
PM and consists of 322 small balances averaging $660 
each. Risk assessed as low."

Sarah: "Excellent reasoning. Documented nicely."

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
Good work, Emma. A few documentation issues but 
substantively sound. Approved with comments addressed.

SIGN-OFF:
Reviewed by: Sarah Williams, Senior Auditor
Date: January 19, 2026

💬 MIKE'S REVIEW CONVERSATION WITH SARAH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DATE: January 25, 2026
TOPIC: Revenue workpapers review

Mike: "Sarah, I've reviewed your revenue work. Really 
thorough job on the ASC 606 analysis. A few things..."

Sarah: "Sure, what questions do you have?"

Mike: "The $78K revenue adjustment - walk me through 
how you found that."

Sarah: "I reviewed all 40 contracts. Three contracts 
had annual subscriptions starting in December. Client 
recognized full year revenue in December instead of 
deferring 11 months into 2026."

Mike: "And you're confident this wasn't intentional?"

Sarah: "I don't think so. Lisa seemed genuinely 
surprised when I showed her. She immediately agreed 
to adjust. Her spreadsheet formula didn't catch 
December start dates properly."

Mike: "Okay, good. That's an important distinction 
for fraud risk assessment. What's your recommendation 
to prevent this?"

Sarah: "I suggested she add a monthly check - review 
new contracts that month and verify deferred revenue 
setup. Also recommended revenue recognition software 
to automate this."

Mike: "Good. Make sure that's in the management letter. 
Next question - your sample of 40 contracts covered 
how much revenue?"

Sarah: "65% of total subscription revenue. All multi-year 
contracts plus top 20 customers."

Mike: "And the remaining 35%?"

Sarah: "Smaller monthly subscriptions. I performed 
analytics on those - trend analysis looked reasonable, 
no spikes or anomalies."

Mike: "Comfortable that's sufficient?"

Sarah: "Yes. The risk is in multi-year contracts and 
timing, which we tested extensively. Monthly subscriptions 
are straightforward and automated through Stripe."

Mike: "Agreed. One last thing - cut-off testing. You 
tested 2 weeks each side of year-end. Why 2 weeks 
instead of our standard 1 week?"

Sarah: "Revenue is a significant risk, and I wanted 
extra assurance. Also, their billing cycles are monthly, 
so 2 weeks captures more of the billing cycle."

Mike: "Smart. Okay, I'm comfortable with your revenue 
work. Document this conversation in your summary memo 
and we're good."

Sarah: "Will do. Thanks Mike."

MIKE'S SIGN-OFF:
Reviewed revenue workpapers. Extensive testing performed, 
appropriate conclusions reached. One material adjustment 
identified and posted by client. Approved for partner review.

```
📋 PARTNER REVIEW MEETING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DATE: February 5, 2026, 2:00 PM
LOCATION: Acme CPA office
ATTENDEES: Jordan (Partner), Mike (Manager)

JORDAN'S REVIEW PROCESS:

1. INDEPENDENT REVIEW (8 hours)
Jordan spends 2 days reviewing entire file:
- All significant risk areas (revenue, stock comp)
- Financial statements
- Adjustments and summary memos
- Client correspondence
- Significant judgments

2. REVIEW MEETING WITH MIKE (2 hours)

Jordan: "Mike, good work on this engagement. I have 
some questions..."

DISCUSSION POINT #1: Materiality

Jordan: "You used revenue as the benchmark for 
materiality. Walk me through that decision."

Mike: "TechStart is pre-profit, growing company. 
Revenue is what investors care about. Using income 
would give us too low a materiality ($20K) for an 
efficient audit."

Jordan: "I agree with the approach. 0.5% of revenue 
seems reasonable. Did you re-evaluate materiality 
after finding the $78K revenue adjustment?"

Mike: "Yes - final revenue was $12.22M, so materiality 
would be $61K. We kept it at $60K. Still appropriate."

Jordan: "Good. Documented?"

Mike: "Yes, in the planning memo and final summary memo."

DISCUSSION POINT #2: Revenue Adjustment

Jordan: "The $78K revenue adjustment - significant 
amount. Talk me through the fraud risk assessment."

Mike: "We considered it. The amount is material, and 
there's funding pressure. However:
- Lisa immediately agreed when Sarah found it
- Appears to be error, not intentional manipulation
- Corrected in same year before close
- No pattern of aggressive accounting
- Other revenue testing didn't find similar issues"

Jordan: "I reviewed Sarah's workpaper. The error was 
in Lisa's spreadsheet formula, not manual manipulation?"

Mike: "Correct. The formula didn't handle December 
start dates properly. Systematic error, not selective."

Jordan: "And our recommendation?"

Mike: "Management letter includes recommendation for 
revenue recognition software and formal policy."

Jordan: "I'm comfortable this was error, not fraud. 
But it does highlight the control deficiency - Lisa 
has too much responsibility without review."

Mike: "Agreed. That's also in the management letter."

DISCUSSION POINT #3: Stock-Based Compensation

Jordan: "Stock comp is complex. Sarah tested it, but 
did we consider using a specialist?"

Mike: "We discussed it. Sarah reviewed the 409A 
valuation, which was done by a reputable firm 
(ValuationCo). Their methodology is sound - option 
pricing model with reasonable assumptions."

Jordan: "And Sarah's comfortable with the valuation?"

Mike: "Yes. She has experience with SaaS valuations. 
The assumptions (volatility, discount rate) are within 
industry norms. We also tested the math - calculations 
are correct."

Jordan: "Okay. If this were more complex or the amounts 
were larger, I'd want a specialist. But for $500K with 
a third-party valuation already performed, I think 
Sarah's review is sufficient."

DISCUSSION POINT #4: Going Concern

Jordan: "They're burning $200K/month with 12 months 
runway. Did you assess going concern?"

Mike: "Yes. They have:
- 12 months of cash
- Series A signed term sheet ($10M)
- Expected close in March 2026
- Strong revenue growth (customer retention)

We concluded no substantial doubt. Disclosed the Series A 
in subsequent events note."

Jordan: "What if the Series A falls through?"

Mike: "We discussed with Lisa. They have contingency - 
could cut burn rate to $100K/month if needed. That 
extends runway to 24 months. Also have other investor 
interest."

Jordan: "Documented in the going concern memo?"

Mike: "Yes, including management's plans if Series A 
doesn't close."

Jordan: "Good."

DISCUSSION POINT #5: Financial Statements

Jordan: "I reviewed the financial statements. A few 
questions on disclosures..."

[Reviews each footnote]

"Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - needs to 
include revenue recognition policy. Can you add that?"

Mike: "Yes, I'll draft it today."

"Note 8 - Subsequent Events - Series A is disclosed. 
Looks good."

"Note 6 - Stock-Based Compensation - might add the 
valuation assumptions (volatility %, discount rate). 
More transparency for investors."

Mike: "Good idea. I'll add that."

FINAL ASSESSMENT:

Jordan: "Overall, I'm satisfied with the audit quality. 
Good work by the team. A few minor disclosure tweaks, 
but nothing major.

I'm prepared to sign the report once:
1. Revenue recognition policy added to footnotes
2. Stock comp valuation assumptions added
3. Management representation letter obtained
4. Final review notes cleared

Target for final report: February 15."

Mike: "I'll get those done this week."

Jordan: "Great. Let's plan to deliver the report to 
Lisa on February 15, then meet with her and David to 
present on February 17."

SIGN-OFF:
Partner review complete. Audit quality is acceptable. 
Minor disclosure enhancements needed. File approved 
subject to completion of items noted above.

Date: February 5, 2026

## 💡 Review Best Practices

:::tip Quality Control Tips

**1. Review Daily, Not Weekly**
Sarah should review Emma's work each day, not batch it at the end. Catches issues early.

**2. Use Review Notes Effectively**
Be specific in comments. "See me" is not helpful. "Please document the source of this number" is clear.

**3. Don't Review Defensively**
Seniors: Don't just check boxes. Really think about whether procedures make sense.

**4. Ask "Why?" Frequently**
Managers/Partners: If something seems odd, ask why. Don't assume the team thought it through.

**5. Document Verbal Discussions**
If you discuss something significant verbally, document it. "Per discussion with Sarah on 1/25..."

**6. Independent Mindset**
Partners: Don't just rely on team's work. Independently think through significant judgments.

**7. Timely Reviews**
Don't let workpapers pile up. Emma waiting 2 weeks for review feedback is inefficient.

**8. Balance Perfectionism and Pragmatism**
Strive for quality, but don't nitpick immaterial formatting issues.

**9. Clear Resolution**
When review note is resolved, explicitly state "Resolved - [explanation]" not just ✓

**10. Learn from Reviews**
Staff: Don't just fix issues, understand WHY they were issues. Prevents repeat mistakes.
