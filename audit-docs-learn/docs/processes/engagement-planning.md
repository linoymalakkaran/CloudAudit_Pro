### Step 6: Calculate Materiality

**Actor:** <span className="role-badge manager">Manager</span> (Mike)

**Materiality Calculation:**

```
💰 MATERIALITY CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLIENT: TechStart Inc
PERIOD: FY 2025 (12/31/2025)

FINANCIAL BENCHMARKS (Preliminary):
├── Total Assets: $5,200,000
├── Total Revenue: $12,000,000
├── Pre-tax Income: $400,000 (projected)
├── Total Equity: $3,500,000
└── Total Expenses: $11,600,000

MATERIALITY BENCHMARK SELECTION:

Option 1: Revenue-Based
Revenue: $12,000,000 × 0.5% = $60,000
Rationale: Common for pre-profit/growth companies

Option 2: Asset-Based
Assets: $5,200,000 × 1% = $52,000
Rationale: Conservative approach

Option 3: Equity-Based
Equity: $3,500,000 × 3-5% = $105,000 - $175,000
Rationale: Venture-backed company focus

Option 4: Income-Based
Pre-tax Income: $400,000 × 5% = $20,000
Rationale: Too low for efficient audit (not used)

SELECTED BENCHMARK: Revenue ✓
Reasoning: TechStart is growth-stage, pre-profit company. 
Investors focus on revenue growth and ARR. Revenue is 
stable and predictable basis.

MATERIALITY LEVELS:

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  MATERIALITY DETERMINATION                       ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                                  ║
║  OVERALL MATERIALITY (OM):                       ║
║  $60,000                                         ║
║  (0.5% of projected revenue)                     ║
║                                                  ║
║  PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY (PM):                   ║
║  $45,000                                         ║
║  (75% of OM - standard for moderate risk)        ║
║                                                  ║
║  CLEARLY TRIVIAL THRESHOLD (CTT):                ║
║  $3,000                                          ║
║  (5% of OM)                                      ║
║                                                  ║
║  SPECIFIC MATERIALITY:                           ║
║  Related Party Transactions: $3,000              ║
║  Executive Compensation: $10,000                 ║
║                                                  ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT THIS MEANS:

OVERALL MATERIALITY ($60,000):
- Threshold for opinion modification
- Aggregate of all uncorrected misstatements
- "Would this change a reasonable user's decision?"

PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY ($45,000):
- Working threshold for procedures
- Reduces risk that aggregate errors exceed OM
- Safety margin for undiscovered misstatements

CLEARLY TRIVIAL ($3,000):
- Don't document if less than this
- Accumulate if above this threshold
- Saves time on immaterial items

DOCUMENTATION:
✅ Calculation memo prepared
✅ Benchmark selection rationale documented
✅ Reviewed by partner (Jordan)
✅ Loaded into CloudAudit Pro
✅ Audit team notified

### Step 7: Develop Audit Strategy

**Actor:** <span className="role-badge manager">Manager</span> (Mike)

**Strategy Decision:**

```
📊 AUDIT STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLIENT: TechStart Inc

STRATEGIC APPROACH OPTIONS:

1. SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH
   Focus: Detailed testing of transactions and balances
   When Used: Weak controls or first-year audits
   Effort: High testing, less control work
   
2. CONTROLS-BASED APPROACH
   Focus: Test and rely on internal controls
   When Used: Strong controls, recurring audits
   Effort: Control testing, less substantive work
   
3. COMBINED APPROACH
   Focus: Mix of both strategies
   When Used: Some strong controls, some weak
   Effort: Balanced testing

TECHSTART DECISION: SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH ✓

RATIONALE:
├── First-year audit (controls not previously tested)
├── Small accounting team (limited segregation of duties)
├── No formal control documentation
├── High-risk areas (revenue, stock comp)
├── Funding pressure (fraud risk)
├── More comfortable with detailed testing
└── Baseline for future years

## 💡 Planning Best Practices

:::tip Pro Tips from Experienced Managers

**1. Start Planning Early**
Begin 4-6 weeks before fieldwork. Rushed planning leads to inefficient fieldwork and budget overruns.

**2. Involve the Senior Early**
Get Sarah involved in planning, not just fieldwork. Her technical knowledge prevents surprises later.

**3. Face-to-Face Planning Meeting**
Always do this in person (or video) if possible. Email/phone doesn't build the relationship you need.

**4. Be Realistic with Budget**
First-year audits ALWAYS take longer. Budget 20-30% more than you think. Better to come in under budget!

**5. Document Everything**
If it's not documented, it didn't happen. Reviewers and regulators will ask for your planning documentation.

**6. Client-Specific Procedures**
Don't just use last year's program. Tailor procedures to THIS client's specific risks and business.

**7. Communicate Clearly with Client**
Set expectations early. Tell them what you need, when you need it, and why. Prevents frustration later.

**8. Get Partner Buy-In**
Review your plan with Jordan before the client meeting. Partner should agree with your approach.

**9. Technology is Your Friend**
Use CloudAudit Pro to organize everything. Don't rely on spreadsheets and email threads.

**10. Plan for Problems**
Build buffer time for unexpected issues. First-year audits ALWAYS have surprises!
