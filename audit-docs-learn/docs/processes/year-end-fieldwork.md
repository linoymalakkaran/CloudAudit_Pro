### Week 3: Complex & High-Risk Areas

**Revenue Recognition Testing (Sarah's Work):**

```
💰 REVENUE TESTING - SIGNIFICANT RISK AREA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SARAH'S WORKPAPER: Revenue Recognition

CLIENT: TechStart Inc
PERIOD: Year ended December 31, 2025
BALANCE: $12,300,000

RISK ASSESSMENT: 🔴 SIGNIFICANT RISK
- Complex ASC 606 application
- Subscription timing judgment
- First year applying standard
- Material to financial statements
- Funding pressure (fraud risk)

AUDIT APPROACH: Substantive+
Hours budgeted: 45 hours
Actual hours: 48 hours (6% over budget)

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REVIEW

Obtained and reviewed TechStart's revenue policy:
- Subscription revenue: Recognized ratably over term
- Annual subscriptions: Deferred and recognized monthly
- Implementation services: Recognized upon completion
- Training: Recognized when delivered

Assessment: Policy appears reasonable under ASC 606

However: Policy documentation is informal (Word doc, 
not formally approved by board)

Recommendation: Formalize policy with board approval

2. CONTRACT REVIEW (ASC 606 5-STEP ANALYSIS)

Sample: 40 contracts selected (increased from typical 25)
- All multi-year contracts (15 contracts) = 100%
- Top 20 customers by revenue
- Random sample of 5 additional contracts

For each contract, performed ASC 606 analysis:

STEP 1: Identify the contract
STEP 2: Identify performance obligations
STEP 3: Determine transaction price
STEP 4: Allocate price to performance obligations
STEP 5: Recognize revenue when obligations satisfied

EXAMPLE - ABC CORP CONTRACT:

Contract Date: January 15, 2025
Contract Term: 3 years (Jan 2025 - Dec 2027)
Total Value: $180,000 ($5,000/month)
Payment: Annual upfront ($60,000/year)

ASC 606 ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Valid contract ✓ (signed by both parties)
Step 2: Performance obligation = SaaS platform access
Step 3: Transaction price = $180,000 over 3 years
Step 4: Single obligation, no allocation needed
Step 5: Recognize $5,000/month over 36 months

CLIENT'S TREATMENT:
Year 1 revenue recognized: $60,000 (12 months × $5K) ✓
Deferred revenue 12/31/25: $120,000 ✓

AUDIT CONCLUSION: Proper recognition ✓

[Similar analysis for all 40 contracts...]

FINDINGS FROM CONTRACT REVIEW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING #1: Revenue recognized too early (3 contracts)

Contracts: DEF Industries, GHI Corp, JKL LLC
Issue: Annual subscriptions recognized entirely upfront 
instead of deferred

Example - DEF Industries:
Contract date: December 15, 2025
Term: 12 months (Dec 2025 - Nov 2026)
Payment: $36,000 paid upfront
Client treatment: Recognized $36,000 in December 2025

Correct treatment: 
December 2025: $3,000 (1 month)
Deferred: $33,000 (11 months in 2026)

Total error across 3 contracts: $78,000 over-recognized

PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT #1:
Dr. Revenue                    $78,000
   Cr. Deferred Revenue                $78,000

To defer revenue for subscriptions extending into 2026

Impact: Material! ($78K > PM of $45K)
Client notification: Discussed with Lisa 1/22/26
Client response: Agrees, will post adjustment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING #2: Implementation revenue timing

2 contracts with implementation services bundled

Example - MNO Enterprises:
Contract: $120,000 total
- Subscription: $100,000 (annual)
- Implementation: $20,000 (one-time)

Client treatment: All $120K recognized in Q1 2025

Correct treatment:
- Implementation: $20K upon completion (3/15/25) ✓
- Subscription: $100K ratably over 12 months ✓

Review: Client treatment correct ✓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. CUT-OFF TESTING

Tested last 2 weeks of December + first 2 weeks of Jan:

DECEMBER REVENUE (Last 2 weeks):
- Reviewed 28 transactions totaling $1.2M
- All properly recorded in December ✓
- No premature recognition identified

JANUARY REVENUE (First 2 weeks):
- Reviewed 32 transactions totaling $980K
- All properly recorded in January ✓
- No December revenue delayed into January

Cut-off testing: No exceptions ✓

4. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

Month-over-month trend analysis:

    MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):
    Jan: $980K
    Feb: $985K
    Mar: $992K
    Apr: $1.01M
    May: $1.03M
    Jun: $1.04M
    Jul: $1.06M
    Aug: $1.08M
    Sep: $1.09M
    Oct: $1.11M
    Nov: $1.13M
    Dec: $1.15M

Analysis: Consistent growth, no unusual spikes ✓

Compared to customer count growth:
Jan: 720 customers
Dec: 805 customers
Growth: 12% customer increase

Revenue growth: 17% ($980K → $1.15M MRR)
Explanation: Customer growth + price increases ✓

Comparison to industry (SaaS benchmarks):
TechStart revenue growth: 50% YoY
Industry avg: 40-60% for Series A stage
Assessment: Within normal range ✓

5. CUSTOMER CONFIRMATIONS

(See AR confirmation workpaper)
25 customers confirmed balances and subscription terms
No revenue recognition exceptions from confirmations ✓

CONCLUSION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Revenue is fairly stated, subject to adjustment:

Reported revenue: $12,300,000
Adjustment #1:       (78,000) - Defer to 2026
                   __________
Adjusted revenue:  $12,222,000

Remaining audit difference: $78,000 (passed to 
summary of uncorrected misstatements)

Actually, no - client agreed to adjust. So:

Adjusted revenue: $12,222,000 ✓

SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IDENTIFIED:
Informal revenue recognition process and documentation
Recommendation: Implement formal policy, board approval, 
systematic contract review process

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ATTENDEES:
- Mike Johnson (Manager, Acme CPA)
- Sarah Williams (Senior, Acme CPA)
- Lisa Chen (CFO, TechStart)
- David Park (CEO, TechStart)

AGENDA:

1. FIELDWORK RECAP (Mike)
   
   "We've completed our fieldwork. Overall, your 
   financials are in good shape. We identified three 
   adjustments, which Lisa has posted."

2. ADJUSTMENTS REVIEW (Sarah)
   
   Walks through each adjustment with explanations
   
   David: "The revenue adjustment - that's concerning. 
   How did we miss that?"
   
   Sarah: "ASC 606 is complex, and you're in your first 
   year applying it. This is exactly why you have an 
   audit - to catch these things before they become issues 
   with investors."
   
   Lisa: "I've already updated my spreadsheet to prevent 
   this going forward."

3. FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS (Mike)
   
   CONTROL DEFICIENCY #1:
   Weak segregation of duties (small team)
   Recommendation: Hire controller
   
   CONTROL DEFICIENCY #2:
   Informal revenue recognition policy
   Recommendation: Formalize with board approval
   
   CONTROL DEFICIENCY #3:
   Manual deferred revenue tracking
   Recommendation: Consider revenue recognition software
   
   David: "We're planning to hire a controller in Q2 
   with the Series A funds. Good to know that's validated 
   by the audit."

4. NEXT STEPS (Mike)
   
   "We're moving into our final review phase. Jordan 
   (partner) will review everything over the next week. 
   We should have a draft report to you by February 10.
   
   One thing we'll need: Management representation letter. 
   I'll send you a draft next week to review."

5. QUESTIONS
   
   Lisa: "When will the final report be ready?"
   
   Mike: "Targeting February 15. That gives you time 
   before your Series A closes in March."
   
   David: "Perfect. Thanks for all your work on this."

## 💡 Fieldwork Best Practices

:::tip Lessons from Experienced Auditors

**1. Stay Organized**
Use CloudAudit Pro to track progress daily. Nothing worse than scrambling at the end to figure out what's done.

**2. Communicate Early and Often**
Don't wait until the end to tell the client about findings. Real-time communication prevents surprises.

**3. Document As You Go**
Complete workpapers daily, not at the end. Your memory fades fast!

**4. Review Workpapers Daily**
Sarah should review Emma's work each evening. Catches errors early before they compound.

**5. Be Flexible But Focused**
Issues will come up. Adjust the plan but don't lose sight of objectives.

**6. Build Client Relationships**
Fieldwork is your chance to really understand the client's business. Ask questions beyond the audit.

**7. Watch the Budget**
Track hours daily. If going over, communicate to Mike immediately so he can adjust.

**8. Quality Over Speed**
Better to spend an extra day doing it right than to rush and miss something material.

**9. Take Breaks**
Fieldwork is intense. Regular breaks prevent burnout and improve work quality.

**10. Celebrate Progress**
Completing a big section like revenue? Take 5 minutes to acknowledge the accomplishment!
