**Meeting with Client:**

**Location:** TechStart Inc Office  
**Attendees:** Robert (CFO), Mike (Manager), Sarah (Senior)

**Mike:** "Thanks for meeting with us, Robert. This is our third year together, so we know your business well. I see you've grown 20% - congratulations!"

**Robert (CFO):** "Thanks! It's been a good year. We launched our subscription model in Q2."

**Mike:** "That's actually what I wanted to discuss. The subscription revenue will need special attention for proper revenue recognition. Can you walk us through how it works?"

**Robert:** "Sure. Customers pay annually upfront for our software. We recognize revenue monthly over the subscription period."

**Mike:** "Perfect - that's the right approach. We'll need to test the deferred revenue calculation. Also, I see you issued stock options?"

**Robert:** "Yes, to 5 key employees. Our attorney valued them."

**Mike:** "We'll need the valuation report. Now, for timing - can you provide the trial balance by January 25?"

**Robert:** *[laughs]* "Last year we were late. I promise this year will be better!"

**Mike:** "I appreciate that. Here's our document request list. Same as last year, plus a few new items for the subscription revenue and stock options."

**Robert:** "Looks reasonable. We'll have most of this ready when you start fieldwork Feb 1."

**Mike's Analysis:**

- Better to be thorough than fast
- Budget has some flex

**Action:**
```
📧 To: Sarah
Subject: Take the Time You Need

Sarah,

I see you're going deep on the revenue procedures - 
perfect! This is our highest risk area.

Take the 2 extra days you need. I'd rather have it 
done right than done fast. New deadline for you: Feb 22.

Let me know if you hit any roadblocks.

Mike

Original: 40 hours (Sarah)
Revised: 48 hours (Sarah)

**Week 5, Wednesday - Issue Identified**

**Sarah Escalates Finding:**

<div className="message-thread">

**📧 From: Sarah Williams**  
**To: Mike Johnson**  
**Subject: 🚨 Potential Issue - TechStart Revenue**

Mike,

I found something concerning in the deferred revenue testing.

**Issue:** TechStart is recognizing subscription revenue over 12 months, but some contracts are actually 18-month subscriptions. They're recognizing revenue too fast.

**Amount:** ~$78,000 over-stated revenue (material!)

**Sample:**
- Contract #347: 18-month term, $90K upfront
- Should recognize: $5K/month over 18 months
- Actually recognizing: $7.5K/month over 12 months
- Over-statement in 2025: ~$15K

Found similar pattern in 5 other contracts.

**Next Steps?**

**Mike's Actions:**

```
1. Review Sarah's work
   ✅ Sample size: Appropriate
   ✅ Math: Correct
   ✅ Conclusion: Valid

2. Assess materiality
   Error: $78,000
   Materiality: $50,000
   Result: MATERIAL ⚠️

3. Prepare for client discussion
   - Document the issue clearly
   - Prepare proposed adjustment
   - Schedule call with Robert (CFO)

4. Email to Sarah:
   "Great catch! This is material. I'll discuss 
   with Robert tomorrow. Excellent work on this."
```

**Mike's Call with Client:**

<div className="message-thread">

**📞 Phone Call - Mike & Robert**

**Mike:** "Robert, we found an issue with revenue recognition I need to discuss."

**Robert:** "Okay, what's going on?"

**Mike:** "Your team is recognizing all subscriptions over 12 months, but some are 18-month contracts. You're recognizing revenue too fast."

**Robert:** *[pause]* "Oh no. How much?"

**Mike:** "We sampled 30 contracts and found it in 6. Extrapolating, it's about $78,000 overstated for 2025."

**Robert:** "That's above your materiality threshold, right?"

**Mike:** "Yes, materiality is $50K. This needs to be adjusted."

**Robert:** "I'll talk to our finance team. This was an oversight - we updated our billing system but didn't update the revenue recognition schedule."

**Mike:** "Happens more often than you'd think. The fix is straightforward - adjust the deferred revenue and recognize properly going forward."

**Robert:** "Will this delay the audit?"

**Mike:** "Slightly. You'll need to provide a corrected deferred revenue schedule. We'll need to re-test. Maybe a week delay."

**Robert:** "Understood. I'll get the corrected schedule to you by Friday."

**Mike:** "Perfect. I appreciate your quick response on this."

**Proposed Audit Adjustment:**

**CC:** Sarah Williams  
**Subject:** Review Comments - TechStart

Emma,

Great work overall! Most procedures look excellent.

**✅ Approved (20 procedures):**
All cash and expense procedures look good - nice job!

**⏳ Needs Revision (3 procedures):**

1. **AP Aging - Needs larger sample**
   - Current sample: 10 items
   - Increase to: 15 items
   - Why: Total AP is material ($247K)

2. **Expense Sample - Missing one receipt**
   - Invoice #3481 - need supporting documentation
   - Check with client

3. **Credit Card Review - Explain variance**
   - Dec vs Nov: +45% increase
   - Need explanation in workpaper

These are minor. Should take you 2-3 hours. Let's have them done by tomorrow EOD.

Overall: Really solid work! 🎉

## 💡 Mike's Pro Tips

:::tip Manager Wisdom

**1. Plan More Than You Think You Need**
Spend 15-20% of budget on planning. It pays off 10x during fieldwork.

**2. Communicate Early and Often**
Don't wait for weekly check-ins. Real-time communication prevents surprises.

**3. Trust But Verify**
Give your team autonomy, but review thoroughly. Quality is your responsibility.

**4. Manage Client Expectations**
Underpromise and overdeliver. If you say March 31, deliver March 28.

**5. Document Everything**
If it's not documented, it didn't happen. This protects you and the client.

**6. Develop Your Team**
Your success depends on their success. Invest in training and feedback.

**7. Know When to Escalate**
Don't try to solve every problem yourself. Know when to involve partners.

**8. Balance Budget vs Quality**
Never sacrifice quality for budget. A redo costs more than doing it right.

## 🚨 Handling Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Team Member Underperforming

**Scenario:** Tom's procedures are consistently late and need rework

**Mike's Approach:**

    A[Notice Pattern] --> B[Gather Facts]
    B --> C[Private Conversation]
    C --> D{Root Cause?}
    D -->|Lack of Skills| E[Provide Training]

    style A fill:#ff9800,color:#fff
    style C fill:#2196f3,color:#fff
    style I fill:#4caf50,color:#fff
```

**Mike's Conversation:**

<div className="message-thread">

**Setting:** Private meeting, 1-on-1

**Mike:** "Tom, thanks for meeting. I wanted to check in on RetailCo. I've noticed you're behind on a few procedures. What's going on?"

**Tom:** "Yeah, I'm struggling with the inventory procedures. I've never done them before."

**Mike:** "Ah, I should have caught that. This is your first inventory observation, right?"

**Tom:** "Yes. I'm not sure what I'm looking for."

**Mike:** "My fault - I should have paired you with David for training. Here's what we'll do:

1. David will walk you through inventory procedures tomorrow
2. You'll shadow him on the next count
3. Then you'll do one together
4. Then you'll do one solo with his review

Sound good?"

**Tom:** "That would really help. Thanks."

**Mike:** "No problem. Communication goes both ways - next time, speak up sooner if you're stuck. Deal?"

**Tom:** "Deal."

</div>

### Challenge 2: Client Pushback on Finding

**Scenario:** Client doesn't want to adjust for material error

**Mike's Response:**

```
📞 Client Call - Mike's Approach

CLIENT: "This $78K adjustment will tank our bonuses.
         Can't we just fix it next year?"

MIKE (Calm & Professional):
"I understand the impact, Robert. Let me explain why
we can't do that:

1. **Materiality:** It's above our threshold ($50K)
   
2. **Professional Standards:** GAAS requires us to
   propose adjustments for material errors
   
3. **Audit Opinion:** We can't issue a clean opinion
   with a known material error
   
4. **Your Credibility:** Investors/lenders trust your
   financials. An error undermines that trust

OPTIONS:
A. Adjust and explain to stakeholders (recommended)
B. We issue a qualified opinion (not recommended)
C. You find other auditors (really not recommended)

I know it's painful, but it's the right thing to do.
Let's discuss how to communicate this to your board."

RESULT: Client agrees to adjust
```

### Challenge 3: Running Over Budget

**Scenario:** TechStart audit is 15% over budget

**Mike's Analysis:**

```markdown
## Budget Variance Analysis - TechStart FY2025

### Original Budget
- Planning: 10 hours
- Fieldwork: 120 hours  
- Completion: 20 hours
- **Total: 150 hours @ $167/hr = $25,000**

### Actual Hours
- Planning: 11 hours (+1)
- Fieldwork: 138 hours (+18)
- Completion: 23 hours (+3)
- **Total: 172 hours = $28,750 (+$3,750 / +15%)**

### Reasons for Overrun

1. **Revenue Issue (10 hours)**
   - Discovery: 4 hours
   - Additional testing: 4 hours
   - Client discussion: 2 hours
   - **Justifiable:** Material finding

2. **New SaaS Model (6 hours)**
   - Complex revenue recognition
   - More research needed
   - **Justifiable:** Higher risk

3. **Inefficiency (6 hours)**
   - Emma's AP sample too small (rework)
   - Miscommunication on procedures
   - **Unjustifiable:** Our fault

### Decision
- **Bill client:** 166 hours ($27,750)
- **Absorb:** 6 hours ($1,000)
- **Reason:** Justify material work, eat inefficiency

### Lessons Learned
1. Budget more for first-year SaaS clients
2. Clearer communication on expectations
3. Larger samples upfront to avoid rework

### Future
- Next year: Budget 160 hours (+10 hours)
- Rationale: Revenue complexity will continue
