    style A fill:#2196f3,color:#fff
    style E fill:#4caf50,color:#fff
```

**Sarah's Research Notes:**

```markdown
# Stock Options Research - TechStart Audit

## Standards
- ASC 718: Compensation - Stock Compensation
- Applies to: Stock options granted to employees
- Key: Fair value on grant date

## TechStart Specifics
- 5 employees received options
- Grant date: March 15, 2025
- Exercise price: $10/share
- Fair value per option: $4.25 (per valuation report)
- Total expense: $125,000 (to be recognized over vesting period)

## Audit Procedures Needed
1. Review option plan document
2. Review grant agreements
3. Review valuation report
4. Test expense calculation
5. Verify vesting schedule
6. Check disclosure adequacy

## Questions for Valuation Review
- [ ] Who prepared valuation? (Internal vs external)
- [ ] What method used? (Black-Scholes? Monte Carlo?)
- [ ] What assumptions? (Volatility, risk-free rate, etc.)
- [ ] Are assumptions reasonable?

## Consulted
- David Brown (he reviewed options last month)
- Tech industry guide
- Firm's stock comp training materials

## Confidence Level
Before research: 40% 😰
After research: 85% 😊
```

**Conversation with David:**

<div className="message-thread">

**Sarah:** "Hey David, quick question about stock options. Mike assigned me the equity section for TechStart. You did stock comp on your last audit, right?"

**David:** "Yeah, ManufacCo had employee stock purchase plan. Similar concept."

**Sarah:** "What did you focus on in your review?"

**David:** "Three main things:
1. Valuation report - make sure it's from a credible source and assumptions are reasonable
2. Expense calculation - trace to the grant details
3. Disclosures - ASC 718 requires specific disclosures

Need the workpaper template I used?"

**Sarah:** "That would be amazing! Thanks!"

**David:** "Sent. Let me know if you have questions when you dig in."

**Sarah:** "Will do. Buy you coffee later! ☕"

### Wednesday: Starting Revenue Procedures

**Sarah's First Procedure: Revenue Policy Review**

```
📋 Procedure: Revenue Recognition Policy Review
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Objective: Verify TechStart's revenue recognition policy
           complies with ASC 606 for SaaS subscriptions

Risk Level: 🔴 HIGH (new business model this year)

Steps:
1. Obtain revenue recognition policy memo
2. Review against ASC 606 requirements
3. Test application to sample contracts
4. Document conclusion
```

**Sarah's Work:**

<div className="process-flow">

**Step 1: Request Policy from Client**
```
📧 To: Robert (CFO)
Subject: Revenue Recognition Policy - TechStart Audit

Hi Robert,

Starting on revenue procedures this week. Can you 
provide:

1. Written revenue recognition policy for SaaS 
   subscriptions
2. Sample subscription contracts (5-10)
3. Schedule showing how you calculate monthly 
   revenue recognition

Thanks!
Sarah Williams
Acme CPA Firm
```

**Step 2: Review Client's Policy**
```
📄 TechStart Inc - Revenue Recognition Policy
Effective: April 1, 2025 (SaaS launch)

POLICY:
Customer pays annual subscription fee upfront.
Revenue recognized evenly over subscription term.

EXAMPLE:
Customer pays $12,000 for 12-month subscription
Recognize: $1,000/month for 12 months

ACCOUNTING:
Dr: Cash $12,000
    Cr: Deferred Revenue $12,000
    
Monthly:
Dr: Deferred Revenue $1,000
    Cr: Revenue $1,000
```

**Step 3: Sarah's Analysis**
```
✅ Policy aligns with ASC 606
✅ Subscription is "distinct" performance obligation
✅ Transaction price is fixed (upfront payment)
✅ Recognition over time is appropriate
✅ Even recognition matches transfer of service

CONCLUSION: Policy is appropriate ✅
```

**Step 4: Test Application**
```
Sample: Contract #347
Customer: BigCorp Inc
Contract date: June 1, 2025
Amount: $90,000
Term: 18 months (!!!)

Sarah's Testing:
Expected recognition: $5,000/month for 18 months
Client's recognition: $7,500/month for 12 months

❌ ERROR FOUND!
```

</div>

**Sarah's Discovery:**

```
🚨 POTENTIAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Contract #347:
- Term: 18 months (not 12!)
- Should recognize: $5,000/month × 18 months
- Actually recognizing: $7,500/month × 12 months

Impact:
- Over-stated revenue in 2025
- Under-stated deferred revenue

Sarah's Next Steps:
1. Test more contracts (expand sample)
2. Quantify total impact
3. Escalate to Mike immediately
```

**Sarah's Email to Mike:**

<div className="message-thread">

**📧 From: Sarah Williams**  
**To: Mike Johnson**  
**Subject: 🚨 Potential Issue - TechStart Revenue**  
**Priority: HIGH**

Mike,

I found something concerning in the revenue testing.

**Issue:** TechStart is recognizing subscription revenue 
over 12 months, but some contracts are actually 18-month 
subscriptions. They're recognizing revenue too fast.

**Initial Sample:**
- Contract #347: 18-month term, recognizing over 12 months
- Over-statement: ~$15,000 on this one contract

**My Plan:**
1. Expand sample to quantify full impact
2. Document all errors found
3. Prepare summary for your review

Should I continue with expanded testing or wait for 
your direction?

Sarah

**Sarah's Workpaper:**

```markdown
# Workpaper: Revenue Recognition Testing
## TechStart Inc - FY 2025
### Prepared by: Sarah Williams, CPA
### Date: February 4, 2026

## Objective
Test revenue recognition for SaaS subscriptions to verify 
compliance with ASC 606 and company policy.

## Procedure Performed
Selected 30 subscription contracts (25% of population) and:
1. Verified contract terms (start date, amount, duration)
2. Recalculated monthly revenue recognition
3. Compared to company's actual recognition
4. Investigated variances

## Population
- Total contracts: 120
- Total revenue: $4,200,000
- Average contract: $35,000

## Sample Selection
Used random sampling, stratified by amount:
- Large (>$75K): 10 contracts
- Medium ($35K-$75K): 12 contracts
- Small (<$35K): 8 contracts

## Findings
| Contract | Amount | Term | Correct | Actual | Variance |
|----------|--------|------|---------|--------|----------|
| #347 | $90,000 | 18mo | $5,000/mo | $7,500/mo | +$15,000 |
| #412 | $72,000 | 18mo | $4,000/mo | $6,000/mo | +$12,000 |
| #489 | $54,000 | 24mo | $2,250/mo | $4,500/mo | +$13,500 |
| #501 | $108,000 | 18mo | $6,000/mo | $9,000/mo | +$18,000 |
| #567 | $90,000 | 18mo | $5,000/mo | $7,500/mo | +$15,000 |
| #623 | $36,000 | 18mo | $2,000/mo | $3,000/mo | +$6,000 |

## Root Cause Analysis
Per discussion with client's Controller:
- Billing system defaults to 12-month recognition
- System not updated when contract terms vary
- Manual override process not consistently applied
- Affects approximately 20% of contracts

## Quantification
Sample error: $79,500
Error rate: 20%
Extrapolated to population: ~$78,000
Materiality: $50,000
**Conclusion: MATERIAL**

## Proposed Adjustment
DR: Revenue $78,000
    CR: Deferred Revenue $78,000

To correct revenue recognition for contracts with terms 
longer than 12 months.

## Client Discussion
- Discussed with CFO Robert (Feb 5)
- Client acknowledged error
- Client agreed to adjust
- Client will fix billing system going forward

## Conclusion
Revenue was materially overstated due to system error in 
recognizing multi-year contracts. Client has agreed to 
proposed adjustment. No further exceptions noted.

**Review #1: Cash Operating - Bank Reconciliation**

```
📄 Emma's Workpaper: Bank Reconciliation
Account: 1000 - Cash Operating  
Bank: First National Bank
Date: December 31, 2025

RECONCILIATION:
Bank balance per statement: $247,350
Add: Deposits in transit     12,500
Less: Outstanding checks     (18,230)
Balance per books:          $241,620 ✅

SARAH'S REVIEW:

✅ Deposits in transit: Cleared in Jan ✅

✅ No unusual items: Correct
✅ Conclusion: Clear and appropriate
✅ Tick marks explained: Yes
✅ Source documents: Attached

REVIEW NOTES:
"Excellent work Emma! Reconciliation is clean, 
documentation is thorough, and conclusion is clear.

One minor suggestion: When you note 'cleared in 
January,' include the specific date (e.g., 'cleared 
Jan 5'). More precise = better documentation.

Overall: Great job! 🎉

Approved: Sarah Williams, Senior Auditor
Date: Feb 5, 2026"
```

**Review #2: AP Aging - Needs Revision**

```
📄 Emma's Workpaper: AP Aging Analysis
Account: 2000 - Accounts Payable
Date: December 31, 2025

EMMA'S WORK:
Total AP: $247,000
Sample: 10 invoices ($87,000 = 35%)

SARAH'S REVIEW:

✅ Sample selection: Appropriate
⚠️  Sample size: Too small for this balance
❌ Documentation: Missing 1 invoice support
✅ Testing: Correct where performed
⚠️  Conclusion: Doesn't address population

REVIEW COMMENTS TO EMMA:

"Good start Emma! A few things to address:

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. **Expand sample** ⚠️
   - Current: 10 items (35% $)
   - Need: 15 items (50%+ $)
   - Why: $247K is material, needs more coverage
   
2. **Missing support** ❌
   - Invoice #3847 - need PDF from client
   
3. **Strengthen conclusion** ⚠️
   - Current: 'Sample was correct'
   - Better: 'Based on testing 50% of AP, balances 
     appear fairly stated. No exceptions noted.'

TEACHING MOMENT:
For material account balances, we typically want 50%+ 
dollar coverage. Think: 'If I only tested this sample, 
would I catch a problem?' More coverage = more confidence.

Estimated time to fix: 2 hours

Let me know when you've revised - happy to answer questions!

Sarah"

## 💡 Sarah's Pro Tips

:::tip Senior Auditor Wisdom

**1. Document Like You'll Be Sued**
Your workpapers should stand alone. If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, could someone else understand your work?

**2. Review with Fresh Eyes**
Don't review Emma's work right after lunch when you're tired. Morning brain = better catches.

**3. Teach Don't Just Fix**
When Emma makes a mistake, explain WHY it's wrong, not just WHAT to fix. Teaching creates better auditors.

**4. Know When to Escalate**
Finding a $78K error = tell Mike immediately. Don't wait days trying to figure it out alone.

**5. Stay Current on Standards**
Revenue recognition changed with ASC 606. Leases changed with ASC 842. If you're not learning, you're falling behind.

**6. Build Your Reputation**
Every workpaper is a reflection of you. Excellent work = more interesting assignments = faster promotions.

**7. Master One Complex Area**
I became the "SaaS revenue expert." Being THE person for something makes you invaluable.

**8. Be Kind to Staff**
We were all new once. Patience + encouragement > criticism.

## 🚨 Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Finding Material Error

**Sarah's Experience:**

```
😰 Initial Reaction:
"Oh no, I found a big error. This is going to delay 
everything and upset the client and Mike will think 
I did something wrong..."

😌 Experienced Sarah Knows:
"This is literally my job. Finding errors protects 
the client and users of their financials. Mike will 
be pleased I caught it."

📋 Proper Response:
1. ✅ Document thoroughly
2. ✅ Quantify completely  
3. ✅ Inform manager immediately
4. ✅ Propose solution
5. ✅ Continue other work

💬 Sarah to Emma later:
"Finding errors doesn't mean you did something wrong - 
it means you did something RIGHT. That's what audits 
are for!"
```

---

### Challenge 2: Staff Needs Lots of Help

**Scenario:** Emma asks questions constantly

**Wrong Approach:**
```
❌ "Just figure it out yourself"
❌ "I'm too busy"
❌ Do Emma's work for her
❌ Get frustrated and show it
```

**Sarah's Approach:**

```
✅ ASSESS THE SITUATION:
Is Emma:
a) New to this procedure? → Teach it
b) Not trying? → Redirect
c) Overwhelmed? → Help prioritize
d) Missing foundational knowledge? → Training needed

✅ SARAH'S TECHNIQUE:
"Emma, I notice you're asking a lot of questions on 
bank reconciliations. Let's do one together - I'll 
walk you through it step-by-step. Then you do the 
next one, and I'll review it with you immediately. 
Then you do the rest on your own. Sound good?"

✅ RESULT:
- Emma learns the procedure
- Future questions decrease
- Sarah's time investment pays off
- Emma feels supported not criticized

### Challenge 3: Disagreeing with Manager

**Scenario:** Mike wants smaller sample, Sarah thinks it's too small

**Sarah's Approach:**

<div className="message-thread">

**Sarah (to herself):**
"Mike said 10 items is enough, but I think we need 15 
given the balance is material. Do I just do what he says 
or do I push back?"

**Sarah's Decision:**
Professional obligation to speak up, but do it respectfully.

**📧 Sarah to Mike:**

"Mike,

Quick question on the AP sample size. You mentioned 
10 items, but I wanted to discuss:

- AP balance: $247K (material)
- 10 items = 35% $ coverage
- Firm guidance suggests 50%+ for material balances

Would 15 items be better to meet our coverage target?

I'm happy to do either - just want to make sure we're 
consistent with methodology.

Sarah"

**📧 Mike's Response:**

"Good catch Sarah - you're right. I was thinking of 
the prior year balance ($150K) which was lower. 15 is 
appropriate here.

Thanks for speaking up!
Mike"

**LESSON:**
- Respectfully questioning judgment is professional
- Back up your position with facts
- Defer if overruled (it's manager's call)
- Document if significant disagreement
